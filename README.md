# Euphoric | Restaurant
Euphoric is a static restaurant reservations website that gives users a luxury experience when dining and booking a reservation.

The project was created for the purpose of improving my skills in UI & UX design, layout, aesthetic, and practicality. Creating the Euphoric restaurant reservation website allowed me to enjoy the process of design & execution at all levels of its development.
