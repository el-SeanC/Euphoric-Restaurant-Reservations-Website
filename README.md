# Euphoric | Restaurant
Euphoric is a static restaurant reservations website that gives users a luxury experience when dining and booking a table at the luxury dining location of their choice.

The project was created for the purpose of improving my skills in UI & UX design, layout, aesthetics, and practicality. Creating the Euphoric restaurant reservation website allowed me to enjoy the process of design & execution at all levels of its development. The creation of this project improved my skills of development in various languages and technologies that were used in its development.
